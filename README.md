üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline for Docker and Kubernetes
Welcome to this repository, which demonstrates the functionality of Docker and Kubernetes in a CI/CD pipeline. This project includes steps for building a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster.

üìÅ Project Files
1. server.js
Purpose: This is the main application file for your Node.js app. It contains the code that defines the application's functionality and handles HTTP requests.

2. Dockerfile
Purpose: Defines the instructions for building a Docker image of your Node.js application. It specifies the environment, dependencies, and how to run your application inside a Docker container.

3. deployment.yaml
Purpose: Defines the Kubernetes Deployment configuration for your Node.js application. It describes the desired state for your application, including the number of replicas and the Docker image to use.

4. service.yaml
Purpose: Defines the Kubernetes Service configuration that exposes your Node.js application to other services or the outside world.

5. .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml
Purpose: Defines the GitHub Actions workflow for automating the CI/CD pipeline. It includes steps for building, testing, and deploying your application.

## üé® **Enhanced File Descriptions**

- **`server.js`:** Contains the logic and route handling for your application.

- **`Dockerfile`:** Used to build the Docker image. Essential instructions are included, such as `FROM node:14`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, and `RUN npm install`.

- **`deployment.yaml`:** Configures how Kubernetes should manage and deploy your application, specifying the number of pods, image version, and other settings.

- **`service.yaml`:** Sets up how your application will be accessed. This includes type (e.g., LoadBalancer, ClusterIP) and selector details to route traffic to the correct pods.

- **`.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`:** Automates your CI/CD process, including steps for code checkout, Docker image building, testing, and deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Overview
Build: The Docker image is built based on the Dockerfile.
Push: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub.
Deploy: The application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using the deployment.yaml and service.yaml files.
